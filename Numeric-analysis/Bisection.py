''''
The Bisection method is a numerical algorithm used to find the root of a continuous function within a given interval. 
It is a simple and robust iterative process that repeatedly bisects the interval and narrows down the range in which the root lies. 
The algorithm is based on the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, 
then it must have at least one root within that interval.
