'''
The Steffensen's method uses the fixed-point iteration technique to approximate the root of a function. 
It improves the rate of convergence by applying the fixed-point iteration twice in each iteration step. 
By using this accelerated iterative approach, it can achieve faster convergence than standard fixed-point iteration methods.

It's important to note that like other iterative methods, the Steffensen's method may not converge 
or converge slowly for certain functions or when the initial guess is far from the root. 
In such cases, alternative numerical methods may be more suitable for finding the root.
